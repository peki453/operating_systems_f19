Answer:

660, 775, 777 are the same commands in octal permission notation. 
    
4: "read"
2: "write"
1: "execute"
0: "no permission"

'chmod 660 _ex3.txt' gives following permissions: 
-rw-rw---- (user and group can read and write, others do not have permissions)

'chmod 775 _ex3.txt' gives following permissions: 
-rwxrwxr-x (user and group have all permissions, others cannot write)

'chmod 777 _ex3.txt' gives following permissions: 
-rwxrwxrwx (everyone have all permissions)
