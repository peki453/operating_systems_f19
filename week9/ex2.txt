Exercise 2 (Week 9):

When maximum sequence is of size 100, then maximum number of misses is 100.

---------------------------------------------------

If sequence is:
s(1) = 1
s(n) = s(n-1)
s(n%(n+1)) = 1; 

10 frames, n < 11  -> Number of misses = n
10 frames, n >= 11 -> Always miss

---------------------------------------------------

If sequence is: 
s(1) = 1
s(2) = 1
s(3) = 1
s(n) = s(n-3) + 1

Number of misses = n
