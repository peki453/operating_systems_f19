*** Physical address ***

Physical address is actual address on RAM. 
It points to the existing memory and it is backed by the hardware.

*** Virtual address ***

Virtual address is address of the data stored in virtual memory.
We cannot directly access virtual address for reading,
so it should be mapped to some adress in the physical memory.
Virtual address may be used to obtain the physical address, by using page tables.
